# Rusty Concurrent Vector Sums

A hobby project to demonstrate the usage of different concurrency libraries in Rust for concurrent vector sum calculations.

This project currently provides three implementations of concurrent sums in:
- [Crossbeam](https://docs.rs/crossbeam/latest/crossbeam/)
- [Rayon](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/)
- [Rust standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)
